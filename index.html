<p>Humans learn by observing and experiencing the physical world. Our brains are very good at prediction and aggregation - if shown 10 different kind of pens, and if presented with a different pen, we can easily identify it as a pen. If asked to imagine a pen, we would imagine one which may not look exactly like any of the ones seen in the past but would still can be classified as a legitimate pen. This task of learning features for a category is one of the prime goals of Machine Learning today. It is not restricted to just images, but can be extended to any form of media like audio, print etc. </p>
<p>Adversarial networks have recently surfaced as a new way to train machines to generate data which is similar to the observed data in the world simply by observing it. This model, popularly known as Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), was proposed and published by Ian Goodfellow in 2016 *0 todo: refernce to paper*. GANs have produced great results in unsupervised and semisupervised learning domain *1 todo: refernce to paper*. </p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
